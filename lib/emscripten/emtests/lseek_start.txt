We encounter various problems like Maximum length palindrome in a string, number of palindromic substrings and many more interesting problems on palindromic substrings . Mostly of these palindromic substring problems have some DP O(n2) solution (n is length of the given string) or then we have a complex algorithm like Manacherâ€™s algorithm which solves the Palindromic problems in linear time.
In this article, we will study an interesting Data Structure, which will solve all the above similar problems in much more simpler way. This data structure is invented by Mikhail Rubinchik.
